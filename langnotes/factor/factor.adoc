== factor

continue on page 49 of dls

=== design

* stack paradigm
* postfix; read left to right, e.g. `2 even? [ "OK" ] [ "Cosmic rays detected" ] if` for `2|2 ? "OK" : "Cosmic ..."`
  ** pipeline [unix cmd pipe] design
* design influenced by forth, joy, cat, oop, metaprogramming
* like lisp, factor is made for dynamicism: scripting, macros, and repl.
* like haskell, data are just nullary functions
  ** all syntactic objects are simply called _words_
* all control flow is `if` branching or recursion
  ** both branches of `if` must have the same stack effects
  ** factor guarantees tail-call optimization!
* excepting row-polymorphic combinators and macros, all words must accept and output a fixed number of words
* latently typed
* has static stack checking in addition to dynamic type checking
* program is words pushed to the stack from left to right, which is naturally also function composition (like other stack langs)
* modules are called _vocabularies_
  ** for maximum flexibility & interactivity, even private identifiers are usable in greater contexts if explicitly referenced
  ** like java public classes, each vocabulary must be defined in a file of the same name
* factor is oop, but all methods are generic
* uses _virtual sequences_, i.e. functions from index to element

=== semantics

* pushing quotations does not use memory

=== the repl

* runs as a gui rather than cli program
* is a client that connects to a repl server
* tracks the stack for you, which makes easy both working with state and debugging

=== syntax

* spaces are required adjacent to delimiters; otherwise, like lisp, they're seen as part of an identifier

|===========================
| {}             | array literal
| []             | quotation (like lisp)
| '[ ... _ ... ] | threading macro, e.g. `5 '[ _ + ]` is equivalent to `[ 5 + ]`
|===========================

==== word definition

[source,factor]
----
: foo stack-effect
  body ... ;
----

where `stack-effect` is the syntax `( input ... -- output ... )`

* the stack effect is for documentation and stack checking only. it's required syntax.
* indentation is purely conventional. `:` & `;` delimit definitions

===== row-polymorphic definitions

`each` has effect `( seq quot -- )`. `quot` may be any effect that balances correctly, e.g:

* `( x elt -- x' )`
* `( x y elt -- x' y' )`
* &c

e.g. `quot` can be a function from one value to one value, or two to two, &c.

* `..a` identifies a row-polymorphic variable, where `a` is any character, and may appear in inputs or [inclusive] outputs
* quotation inputs can be given stack effects by form `name: ( input ... -- output ... )` and row vars in those nested effects will be unified with row variables of the same name in the outer effect or other nested effects.

[source,factor]
----
( ..a seq quot ( ..a elt -- ..a ) -- ..a )
----

===== named inputs

[source,factor]
----
:: foo ( input ... -- output ... )
  body ... ;
----

* with `::` instead of `:`, inputs are lexically scoped and available in `body ...`.
* `expr :> id` or `expr :> ( id ... )` binds to identifiers

this form permits elegant solutions to e.g. factors of a quadratic, whereas joy does not.

=== oop/generics

probably the easiest & most flexible oop ever:

[source,factor]
----
TUPLE: circle r ;
TUPLE: rect l w ;
GENERIC: area ( shape -- area )
M: circle area r>> dup * pi * ;
M: rect area [ l>> ] [ w>> ] bi * ;
----

* >>foo writes, foo>> reads.
* what are
  ** multiple dispatch (planned inclusion in factor, but currently implemented by a library)
  ** predicate classes
?

three functions from class to class:

* derivation
* union (n-ary)
* intersection (n-ary)

three types of classes:

* primitive
* tuple
* derived
* predicate (subclass B of A where A consists of instances satisfying a predicate)

primitive & tuple classes use >> & << (but not derived ones?)

=== common funcs

==== stack shuffle

|====================
| drop | x --
| dup  | x -- x x
| over | x y -- x y x
| swap | x y -- y x
|====================

* remember that input & output names are programmatically unrelated

mentally tracking stack effects is troublesome. you should use three easy-accounting fundamental combinators:

[options="header"]
|======================================================================================================
| word   | description                            | example
| cleave | apply multiple operations to one datum | 5 { [ 1 + ] [ 2 - ] } cleave -> 6 3
| spread | pointwise application                  | "A" "b" { [ >lower ] [ >upper ] } spread -> "a" "B"
| napply | apply an operation to n stack items    | "A" "B" [ >lower ] 2 napply -> "a" "b"
|======================================================================================================

bi & tri combinators are a bit more convenient: they eliminate braces or a number argument:

* `bi` & `tri` are 2- & 3-cleave
* `bi*` & `tri*` are 2- & 3-spread
* `bi@` & `tri@` are 2- & 3-apply

==== combinators

==== analagous or equivalent

[options="header"]

| factor | other
| each   | mapM_
| map    | map
| reduce | fold

==== unique to factor

[options="header"]

| word or syntax | meaning
| :              | define new word

|=================================

=== examples

each example here is a 1-liner

[source,factor]
----
{ 1 2 3 4 } 0 [ + ] reduce
{ "hello" "there" "boi" } [ print ] each
[ "#" head? not ] filter [ string>number ] map 0 [ + ] reduce
----

.tail, na√Øve, and sequence factorial
[source,factor]
----
: tail-factorial ( acc n -- n! )
  dup 0 =
  [ drop ]
  [ [ * ] [ 1 - ] bi tail-factorial ]
  if ;

: factorial ( n -- n! ) 1 swap (factorial) ;

[1,b] product # not even defined as its own function b/c it doesn't need to be; it's not recursive
----

=== caveats

* `print` doesn't accept numbers (generic word `string-lines` does not define a method for the fixnum class)
